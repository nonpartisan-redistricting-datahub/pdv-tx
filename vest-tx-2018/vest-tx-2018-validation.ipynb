    "Election results and precinct shapefile from the Texas Legislative Council (https://data.capitol.texas.gov/). The precinct data files available for download at the TXLC Capitol Data Portal are allocated to Census VTD geography based on Voting Age Population from the 2010 Census. The unallocated precinct results and registration statistics were generously provided by TXLC staff to instead merge with the precinct boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shapefile includes unallocated Voter Registration (VR) and Spanish Surname Voter Registration (SSVR) for the November 2018 general election. Any VR data analysis of these unallocated precinct results should utilize this unallocated VR data rather than the VR data allocated by VTD available for download at CDP. SSVR is denoted as a percentile of total VR for each precinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precinct results for the following counties were replaced in whole or in part with county source files or with precinct data provided via the Secretary of State: Atascosa, Bexar, Blanco, Borden, Bowie, Brewster, Brown, Carson, Cherokee, Cochran, Comanche, Cooke, Culberson, Duval, Fort Bend, Gillespie, Hartley, Haskell, Hays, Hood, Jefferson, Jim Hogg, Johnson, Lamar, Matagorda, Midland, Nolan, Ochiltree, Robertson, Rockwall, Rusk, Starr, Terrell, Tyler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precinct 4/6 in Gonzales was merged prior to 2008. Gonzales 4 was the city of Nixon while Gonzales 6 was the surrounding county precinct. However, they reappear as separate line items in the 2018 general election county report. Since these are otherwise regarded as a unitary precinct and it is unclear that the separate 2018 line items correspond to the obsolete boundaries the results for Gonzales 4/6 were combined in the shapefile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precinct totals for the counties listed below do not add up to the Secretary of State County Canvass for one or more offices. Most commonly this is due to omission of some ballots counted after election day from either the county precinct reports or from summary results certified to the state. In some cases these involve data entry errors where numbers were transposed, dropped, or added in one or more precincts or in countywide summations. In some cases corrections to the initial precinct results were made after the certification deadline.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most of the discrepancies are in single digits or low double digits. The exceptions are an 80 vote overreport from Jackson for Ted Cruz (R) for U.S. Senate, a 2000 vote overreport from Galveston for Ken Paxton (R) for Attorney General, a 273 vote underreport from Somervell for Justin Nelson (D) for Attorney General, a 2000 vote underreport from Starr for Jimmy Blacklock (R) for Supreme Court Justice 2, an 8470 vote underreport from Wichita for Steven Kirkland (D) for Supreme Court Justice 2, a 90 vote underreport from Moore for Michelle Slaughter (R) for Criminal Appeals Judge 8, a 10229 vote underreport from Waller for Michelle Slaughter (R) for Criminal Appeals Judge 8, and a 2934 vote underreport from Waller for Mark Ash (L) for Criminal Appeals Judge 8.\n",

This includes all early ballots in Collingsworth, Crockett, Dawson, Hudspeth, Kent, McMullen, and Trinity. Mail ballots in Armstrong. Federal and/or limited ballots in Bexar, Brazos, Hays, Jefferson, and Rockwall. Provisional and military ballots in Bowie.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following counties reported combined results for some precincts. As these specific precincts align with VTD boundaries the combined results were replaced with the VTD allocated precinct results from the TXLC Capitol Data Portal. Any data corrections or distributions noted above were transferred accordingly.\n",
